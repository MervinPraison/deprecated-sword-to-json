Consider expected verse count

31102 + 3 John 15 + Revelation 12:18 = 31104

Update chapter-and-verse on Rev 12:18 or Romans 14 / Romans 16?

Rethink bloated verse count check logic - esp. WEB
How do verses moved from Romans 16 to Romans 14 effect logic?

check version text against bible gateway / bible.com text

add recommended reading age

TODOs

introduce extra checks - check with sword data and add own JSON data

split into multiple programs - one for single one for multi
