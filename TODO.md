IMPORTANT: DO NOT DELETE NOTES WHICH MAY BE HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE

Consider expected verse count

31102 + 3 John 15 + Revelation 12:18 = 31104

Update chapter-and-verse on Rev 12:18 or Romans 14 / Romans 16?

Rethink bloated verse count check logic - esp. WEB
How do verses moved from Romans 16 to Romans 14 effect logic?

check version text against bible gateway / bible.com text

add recommended reading age

TODOs

introduce extra checks - check with sword data

tidy verses

bibles folder should maintain folder structure

look at popularity on zefania
LOOK FOR BIBLES IN XML OR JSON - MUST BE TRUSTWORTHY - need comparators
Use OSIS format: <verse osisID="Gen.1.1"><w>In the beginning</w> <w>God</w> <w>created</w> <w>the heaven</w> <w>and</w> <w>the earth</w>.</verse>
Also see OSIS format on https://sourceforge.net/projects/zefania-sharp/files/Bibles
http://wiki.crosswire.org/OSIS_Tutorial
Also see osis-examples folder


IMPORTANT: DO NOT DELETE NOTES WHICH MAY BE HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE



checks for Psalm 1 and virgin

checks against SWORD verse count

put checks for common errors - e.g. BOOK

versions with diff verse numbering in Psalms (see Psalm 51) => CJB, Douay-Rheims, NABRE, OJB (kinda), The Passion Translation (TPT), Tree of Life Version (TLV)

leave hyphens in coz checks wont find prob if comparator agrees - so some versions will and some wont

think about hyphen searching - e.g. will searching for bathsheba find bath-sheba?
